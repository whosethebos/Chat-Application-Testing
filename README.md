# Chat-Application-Testing

In this project we will be testing the web based chat application using the softwares:
WAPT
Test Studio-Telerik test studio
Webload

## WAPT:
WAPT Pro is the core component in a scalable load testing environment. It combines the inherent ease of use that has been recognized in WAPT tools over the last decade with the power of efficiency and a trend towards the modern technologies and practices.
You can create tests for websites, web API services and mobile applications with a built-in test recorder. Extended feature set will let you emulate even the
most intricate communication schemes within the user sessions. The ability to run tests by multiple load generation units lets you verify the performance of high-end server solutions with up to 1M concurrent users. The integration capabilities open the door for regression testing with WAPT Pro in Agile and DevOps environments.

## Test Studio-Telerik test studio:
Telerik Test Studio is a Windows-based software testing tool for web and desktop functional testing, software performance testing, load testing and mobile application testing developed by Telerik. The tool ships with a plugin for Visual Studio and a standalone app that use the same repositories and file formats. Test
Studio supports HTML, AJAX, Silverlight, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript and WPF. Test Studio supports test execution in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Chrome.

## Webload:
WebLOAD is load testing tool, performance testing, stress test web applications. This web and mobile load testing and analysis tool is from RadView Software. Load testing tool WebLOAD combines performance, scalability, and integrity as a single process for the verification of web and mobile applications. It can simulate hundreds of thousands of concurrent users making it possible to test large loads and report bottlenecks, constraints, and weak points within an application.
Using its multi-protocol support, WebLOAD simulates traffic of hundreds of thousands of users and provides analysis data on how the application behaves under load. WebLOAD monitors and incorporates statistics from the various components of the system under test: servers, application server, database, network, load-balancer, firewall, etc., and can also monitor the End User Experience and Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance in production environments.
